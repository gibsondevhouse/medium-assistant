Based on the current state of your project (deep-scribe) and your roadmap in AGENTS.md, here are the recommended next steps for development. The application currently has a solid foundation for researching (routing, topic mapping, RSS), but it lacks the core functionality for persisting and writing that content.1. Implement Draft Management (Persistence Layer)Currently, your "Recent Articles" in the sidebar are hardcoded, and Research Reports exist only in memory (Zustand store). You need a way to save work to the disk.Backend (Electron): Create a DraftService in Electron (electron/services/drafts.ts) to handle reading/writing .md files or a local JSON database (using electron-store or better-sqlite3).Frontend (Store): Create src/store/draftStore.ts to manage the list of drafts and the currently active draft.UI Integration: Update App.tsx sidebar to render real drafts from the store instead of the hardcoded list.2. Build the Markdown EditorREADME.md lists this as "Yet to be Implemented". This is the core "Scribe" experience.Component: Create src/components/Editor/Editor.tsx.Tech: Use an industry-standard library like CodeMirror, Monaco Editor, or TipTap (highly recommended for React/Rich-Text-like Markdown).Features:Syntax highlighting.Live preview split-pane (optional but standard).Auto-save: Hook up the autoSaveInterval from your SettingsModal to trigger saves to the persistence layer.3. Connect Research to Writing (The "Export" Flow)In ResearchReport.tsx, you have an "Export Article" button that currently does nothing.Action: When clicked, this button should:Create a new Draft entity.Populate it with the synthesized markdown content from the research report.Redirect the user to the Editor tab/view with that new draft open.(Optional) Save the raw "Research Nodes" as metadata attached to the draft so the user can reference sources later.4. Chat / "Editor Bot" Side PanelYour sidebar has a "Messages" section placeholder. This should be an "AI Copilot" aware of your current context.Implementation: Create a chat interface component (e.g., src/components/Chat/ChatPanel.tsx).Context Awareness: When sending a message to the AI, inject the current draft content or active research notes into the prompt so the AI can answer questions like "Does this paragraph flow well?" or "Summarize the research I just did."Routing: Use your existing AiRouterService to send these chat messages to the Python backend.5. Expand Python Backend for RAG (Local Intelligence)Currently, main.py is just a router. To make "Deep Scribe" truly powerful, use the Python environment for local data processing.Vector Database: Integrate ChromaDB or FAISS in python_backend/.Workflow:When a Research Report is finalized, send the text to Python.Python chunks and embeds the text (using sentence-transformers or Gemini embeddings).Store vectors locally.Allow the Chat/Editor Bot to "query" this knowledge base (RAG) to find specific facts from previous research without re-reading the whole report.Summary ChecklistPriorityFeatureDescriptionHighDrafts File SystemAllow creating, saving, and loading .md files from the local disk.HighThe EditorImplement the writing interface to replace the "Dashboard" view when a draft is selected.MediumResearch ExportMake the "Export Article" button in Research Tab create a real draft file.MediumContextual ChatActivate the "Messages" sidebar to chat with the AI about the currently open draft.LowMedium APIImplement the actual publishing logic to send finished drafts to Medium.
