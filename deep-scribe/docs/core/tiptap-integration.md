# Integrate the Tiptap Editor

Build a rich-text editor that fits your product with exactly the features you need. Tiptap wraps the proven ProseMirror library in a modern, framework-agnostic API and gives you extensions and features for everything.

## What is Tiptap?

Tiptap is a headless rich-text editor framework that lets you build a custom editor completely tailored to your and your customers' needs. It's built on top of ProseMirror, a battle-tested library for building rich-text editors on the web. Under the hood Tiptap heavily relies on [Events](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/api/events), [Commands](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/api/commands), and [Extensions](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/overview) to provide a flexible and powerful API for building editors.

## Why pick Tiptap?

- **Modular by default**: Add only the extensions you need, from bold and links to complex tables and slash-menus. Keep the bundle small and your schema under control.
- **Headless first**: Plug Tiptap into React, Vue, Svelte, plain JS, or any other framework. Or integrate with React [UI Components and templates](https://tiptap.dev/docs/ui-components/getting-started/overview)
- **Open source & Pro extensions**: Tiptap's open source is published on GitHub under the MIT license. When you need advanced features like comments or AI commands drop in paid Tiptap extensions.
