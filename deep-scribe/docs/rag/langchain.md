# LangChain Overview

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

## Core Benefits

- **Context-aware**: Connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
- **Reason**: Rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

## Modules

- **Model I/O**: Interface with language models
- **Retrieval**: Interface with application-specific data
- **Agents**: Let these models choose which tools to use given a high-level directive
